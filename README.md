An SSVEP-Based Mobile BCI Game Application: Brilliant Cat

## Abstract

Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology, which interprets brainwaves to control machines, is increasingly being recognized as a versatile tool in the realm of next-generation interfaces. Particularly, BCI games have garnered attention as a technology for individuals with disabilities and as a segment within the gaming industry for the general populace. Steady State Evoked Potential (SSVEP) stands out in BCI game research due to its reliance on brainwave responses to visual stimuli, offering high information transfer rates and good performance within BCI systems without extensive pre-training requirements.

In this study, we develop an SSVEP-BCI system for frequency classification in brainwaves and propose a mobile BCI game application based on this system. The proposed BCI game distinguishes itself from previous research, mostly focused on PC-based development, by being designed for mobile applications. Through experiments, we verify the significance of BCI games as a novel paradigm and the convenience of mobile BCI games. We anticipate that further research in this area will contribute to the advancement of BCI games.
